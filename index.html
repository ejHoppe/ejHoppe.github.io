                        <p>After graduating from high
                            school, I lacked direction. I had no idea what I
                            wanted to do, but I did have an urge to serve, so I
                            enlisted into the United States Air Force. Over the
                            span of seven years, I served, first as an Airborne
                            Linguist and later as a Signals Analyst where I
                            served two tours in Afghanistan. </p>
                        <p>Once I separated from the Air Force, I transitioned
                            to military consulting with Booz Allen Hamilton.
                            While consulting for the firm, I was introduced to
                            Python, and it was then that I discovered I had a
                            passion for programming. Eventually, my project
                            transitioned from California to Oklahoma, so I
                            decided to move back to Oregon to finally pursue a
                            college education.
                        </p>
                        <p>After three years, I just graduated from Willamette
                            University with a major in computer science and a
                            minor in mathematics. I graduated with department
                            honors for my senior thesis on Generative
                            Adversarial Networks.
