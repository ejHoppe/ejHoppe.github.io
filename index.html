                            <p>After graduating from high school, I enlisted in the
                                United States Air Force. I served for seven years,
                                first as an Airborne Linguist, then as a Tactical
                                Signals Analyst where I completed two tours in
                                Afghanistan. During my second tour, I was a
                                staff sergeant in charge of ten airmen which allowed
                                me to develop crucial leadership skills. Overall,
                                the Air Force instilled a dedication to teamwork,
                                a sense of core values, and a passion for learning,
                                as well as teaching.</p>

                            <p>After the Air Force, I transitioned to military
                                consulting with Booz Allen Hamilton. While
                                at the firm, I was introduced to Python which
                                quickly piqued my interest in programming. I
                                began teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                                Python through sites like freecodecamp.org and
                                checkio.org. Shortly thereafter, the program I was
                                a part of decided to move from California to
                                Oklahoma. Wanting to remain on the west coast, my
                                wife and I decided there was no better time for me
                                to return to college.</p>

                            <p>After three years at Willamette University, I have
                                completed a degree in computer science with a minor
                                in mathematics. Over those years, I focused mainly
                                on Java development, but I was afforded the
                                opportunity to explore a vast variety of tech
                                related subjects. In fact, I graduated with
                                departmental honors for my senior thesis on
                                Generative Adversarial Networks, a topic in machine
                                learning.</p>

                                Seattle, WA this spring where I plan to continue
                                exploring all things programming. I hope to get a
                                full-time job in software or web development. My end
                                goal is to attain a master's degree from the
                                University of Washington's prestigious computer
                                science program.
