                            <p>When I set out to create this program, I wanted
                                to create a flexible neural network package
                                similar to Python's TensorFlow or Java's DL4J.
                                It would allow the programmer to implement as many
                                layers as they wanted, to implement as many
                                neurons (nodes) at each layer, and to be able to
                                choose between several activation functions.
                                Once created, I had hoped to utilize the program
                                to build a generative adversarial network to
                                generate images of numbers.</p>
                            <p>Due to complexity and time constraints, I ended
                                up creating a program that allows a user to implement
                                a neural network with a fixed amount of layers, with
                                as many neurons as the user wants with a few options
                                for activation functions.
                            <p>Once you start the program,
                                you are presented with a basic GUI where you have
                                the option to choose between "Train NN", "Test NN",
                                "Generate", and "Reset".</p>
                        </div>
                        <img id="app-photo" src="Images/app_initial.png">
                        <img id="app-photo" src="Images/app_test.png">
                        <div id="app-explanation">
                            <p>The GUI implements a sample size of 10,000 images
                                pulled from the MNIST dataset (a dataset of
                                handwritten numbers). </p>
                            <p>If you click "Train NN", one of the neural
                                networks will process 3,000 images and learn to
                                classify the numbers 0 through 9.</p>
                            <p>Once you have trained the neural network, you
                                can verify the neutwork's ability to classify
                                numbers by clicking "Test NN". When you click
                                "Test NN", a random number will be selected from
                                the dataset of 10,000. The program will draw
                                that number and the neural network will attempt
                                to label it.
                        </div>

                        <div id="app-explanation">
                            <p>If you would like to generate a number, I
                                recommend starting with a un-trained network. If
                                you start with an already trained discriminator
                                network, it will dominate the generator network,
                                and a number will not be generated. Thus, if
                                "Train NN" has been clicked, I recommend clicking
                                "Reset" before clicking "Generate". </p>
                            <p>When you click "Generate", the program runs through
                                one training cycle, and the final product of the
                                generator network is drawn in the right side of
                                the GUI.

                        <div id=app-explanation>
                            <p>Since each click of the "Generate" button creates
                                one training cycle, it may take six to eight
                                clicks to generate a product. The training is a
                                minmax between the discriminator network and the
                                generator network, thus there is a chance a
                                number won't be produced. If this is the case,
                                click "Reset" and try again.
